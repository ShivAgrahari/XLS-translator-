The provided Python code translates the text content of an Excel file (XLS format) from Chinese to English using the `deep_translator` library. 
It utilizes the `pandas` library to handle data frames, and the `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module for parallel processing to enhance translation speed. 
The code outputs the translated data to a new excel file called 'translated_order_export'.
The elapsed time for the entire process is also measured and displayed, for estimating it I have used the time library.
